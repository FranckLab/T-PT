### Input 3D Image Stack Requirements
* The 3D image stack need to be saved in a 3 dimensional matrix (intensity values are stored at x, y and z position) in vol*.mat files.  

### Running included example case
1. Make sure that the matlab code files are added to the path in Matlab.
2. Download and save the [example volume data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dOVhKywxHJU4J4b4bpE2S5YIYsctZmdG?usp=sharing) in the current directory. 
3. Run the exampleRunFile.m file to track particles in images
